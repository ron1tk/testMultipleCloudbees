This test suite covers all the functions in the provided code, testing both the normal cases and specific behavior (like the print side effect in `greet`). It uses parameterization to efficiently test functions that should simply return a string, ensuring code coverage. The use of `patch` from `unittest.mock` is demonstrated for testing the print side effect in `greet`, adhering to the requirement for mocking where appropriate.
